        <h4 className="poemtext">
        I lie awake at night<br></br>
        Wondering which string<br></br>
        Amongst the armada<br></br>
        Weaves through the emptiness<br></br>
        And find its home in a well of wisdom<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Though lie you might<br></br>
        And think you do<br></br>
        Have you accomplished<br></br>
        What Force<br></br>
        Has divined you?<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        But how does one<br></br>
        Find the answers<br></br>
        When the fog within<br></br>
        Thickens and grows<br></br>
        Obscuring your vision<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Do you know which string<br></br>
        Is weaving where?<br></br>
        And what lies<br></br>
        Beyond this darkness?<br></br>
        Perhaps you have lost something sacred<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Have you looked through nature?<br></br>
        The medicine of early man<br></br>
        Granting you clarity<br></br>
        Beyond measure<br></br>
        Finally the fog lifted!<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Have you found what you seek?<br></br>
        Clearly the strings are visible<br></br>
        Yet the questions of the mind<br></br>
        Outnumber our perception<br></br>
        And lead us astray<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Ignorance is bliss they say<br></br>
        Well I suppose living in obscurity<br></br>
        Means you have less to worry about<br></br>
        And through life you'll find<br></br>
        The endpoint to this string's journey<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        However you ponder how long<br></br>
        This journey might be<br></br>
        And not all journeys are made alike<br></br>
        Perhaps the string guiding your life<br></br>
        Meets despair<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        So you must know the answers<br></br>
        A control-freak!<br></br>
        And so the flesh of the earth<br></br>
        Becomes a routine<br></br>
        Alas clarity once more<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        “Where does each string end?”<br></br>
        You think<br></br>
        As you begin to learn<br></br>
        Deeper about yourself<br></br>
        Endpoint after endpoint<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        What are limitations?<br></br>
        Do you think a running machine<br></br>
        Powered by the soul of oneself<br></br>
        Stops in any sense?<br></br>
        Unless through Nature's might<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        So fly high<br></br>
        Seek the answers<br></br>
        But don't forget about the goal<br></br>
        Which is the main question<br></br>
        “Who are you?”<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Yet you can't listen<br></br>
        Like the innocence of youth<br></br>
        You find meaning after meaning<br></br>
        Rationalizations of the past<br></br>
        Until your vision no longer functions<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        Not in the sense that you go blind<br></br>
        Nor that the fog blocks your sight<br></br>
        But rather loss of function<br></br>
        In this program your soul defines<br></br>
        To finish the journey of the string<br></br>
        </h4>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="poemtext">
        So what have you truly gained?<br></br>
        Was this suitable medicine?<br></br>
        Perhaps I'll try it again<br></br>
        But just know<br></br>
        The clarity you seek<br></br>
        Is not clarity at all<br></br>
        In fact<br></br>
        It's obscurity<br></br>
        </h4>

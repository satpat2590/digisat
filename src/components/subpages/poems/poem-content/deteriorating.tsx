        In the nuances of life<br />
        A man might deviate himself<br />
        Off the continuous path<br />
        Onto one seemingly more dangerous<br />
        But there comes no gain without risk<br />
      </h4>

      <h4 className="poemtext">
        Tread fast<br />
        The trail masks no emotion<br />
        But simply amplifies<br />
        The growing discomfort<br />
        Of the path less taken<br />
      </h4>

      <h4 className="poemtext">
        Regret stays king<br />
        Whilst fear is the prince<br />
        But you<br />
        Simply a pawn<br />
        Of both beings lay be<br />
      </h4>

      <h4 className="poemtext">
        The king strikes your dreams<br />
        Shatter and break as they might<br />
        The path grows colder<br />
        With every milestone<br />
        Left no reason to continue<br />
      </h4>

      <h4 className="poemtext">
        The heat of the August sun strikes<br />
        Those who have traveled together<br />
        Those who have avoided the beaten path<br />
        Bathe in the sweet light<br />
        Free from the king and the prince<br />
      </h4>
      <h4 className="poemtext">
        Only I<br />
        The man traveling on the beaten path<br />
        Am left frozen to the touch<br />
        Regret all but deliverance<br />

            I look into a lake<br></br>
            Reflecting a vision of something so great<br></br>
            Yet who am I looking upon<br></br>
            Except for my own self and my fate<br></br>

            I'm capable of everything<br></br>
            Since my self-love soars<br></br>
            So I don't need anyone else<br></br>
            I'll write my own lore<br></br>

            As my love burns brighter<br></br>
            I start to realize<br></br>
            What purpose does it all serve<br></br>
            If entropy indeed is not the prize<br></br>

            Scales of judgment work<br></br>
            Like the clockworks eternal<br></br>
            Creating a balance between people<br></br>
            Doesn't that seem deceptional?<br></br>

            After what seems like years<br></br>
            I learn it is truly a spectrum<br></br>
            Narcissism possessed by all<br></br>
            Especially in this age in which we march to society's drum<br></br>

            How can you allow just anyone<br></br>
            To share in this warmth of love<br></br>
            You'd be left frozen by your own choices<br></br>
            But I suppose if I had met someone near a dove<br></br>

            Would she really accept me for who I am?<br></br>
            But that would be preposterous<br></br>
            Does this imply I don't love myself?<br></br>
            Perhaps the fire inside did not make me prosperous<br></br>

            So I contemplate and come to a conclusion<br></br>

            Through loss comes gain<br></br>
            Emotions intertwined like holy root<br></br>
            Entropic triumph over zero<br></br>
            Scales of narcissism on mute<br></br>
